I don't know under what license these snippets are licenced/etc, so initially interpret them as gpl

But... currently the only stolen code is taken from github.com/tailscale/tailscale (3 clause bsd?) and github.com/LekKit/RVVM (mpl 2.0), but only a few lines of code (tailscale - in `process_udp` + stun struct definition, rvvm - `SOURCE_LINE`)

So you can ignore the `_license` fields in the files, and interpret the license as whatever license you want, as long as you are sure that this code does not contradict the license under which you wish to interpret this code

The code that is fully written by me can be interpreted as public domain.
